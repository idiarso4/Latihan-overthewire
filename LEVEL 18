# Bandit Level 17 â†’ Level 18

## Level Goal
Menemukan password untuk level selanjutnya dengan membandingkan dua file: passwords.old dan passwords.new yang ada di home directory. Password berada pada baris yang berubah di passwords.new.

## Detailed Command Breakdown

### 1. SSH Connection
```bash
ssh bandit17@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
```

### 2. File Comparison
```bash
# Using diff
diff passwords.old passwords.new

# Using vimdiff
vimdiff passwords.old passwords.new

# Using comm
comm -3 <(sort passwords.old) <(sort passwords.new)
```

## File Comparison Tools

### 1. Diff
```bash
# Basic comparison
diff file1 file2

# Side by side
diff -y file1 file2

# Unified format
diff -u file1 file2

# Recursive comparison
diff -r dir1 dir2
```

### 2. Vimdiff
```bash
# Open files
vimdiff file1 file2

# Navigation
]c          # next difference
[c          # previous difference
do          # get changes from other window
dp          # put changes to other window
```

### 3. Comm
```bash
# Compare sorted files
comm file1 file2

# Show only differences
comm -3 file1 file2

# Show unique lines
comm -23 file1 file2  # unique to file1
comm -13 file1 file2  # unique to file2
```

## Text Processing

### 1. Sort
```bash
# Basic sort
sort file

# Numeric sort
sort -n file

# Reverse sort
sort -r file

# Remove duplicates
sort -u file
```

### 2. Uniq
```bash
# Show unique lines
uniq file

# Count occurrences
uniq -c file

# Show duplicates
uniq -d file

# Show unique only
uniq -u file
```

### 3. Cut and Paste
```bash
# Extract columns
cut -d: -f1 file
cut -c1-10 file

# Combine files
paste file1 file2
paste -d: file1 file2
```

## Advanced Comparison

### 1. Binary Comparison
```bash
# Using cmp
cmp file1 file2
cmp -l file1 file2

# Using hexdump
diff <(hexdump file1) <(hexdump file2)
```

### 2. Directory Comparison
```bash
# Using diff
diff -r dir1 dir2
diff -rq dir1 dir2

# Using rsync
rsync -avn dir1/ dir2/
```

### 3. Content Analysis
```bash
# Word differences
wdiff file1 file2

# Character differences
diff --color -u file1 file2

# Context differences
diff -c file1 file2
```

## File Monitoring

### 1. Change Detection
```bash
# Using watch
watch -d cat file

# Using inotify
inotifywait -m file

# Using tail
tail -f file
```

### 2. Version Control
```bash
# Git diff
git diff file
git diff --word-diff file

# Git log
git log -p file
git blame file
```

### 3. Backup Management
```bash
# Create backup
cp file{,.bak}
cp -a dir{,.bak}

# Compare backups
diff file{,.bak}
rsync -av --dry-run dir/ dir.bak/
```

## Performance Optimization

### 1. Large Files
```bash
# Split files
split -l 1000 large_file prefix_
split -b 1M large_file prefix_

# Compare chunks
diff <(head -n 1000 file1) <(head -n 1000 file2)
```

### 2. Memory Usage
```bash
# Stream comparison
cmp -l file1 file2

# Line by line
while read -r line; do
    grep -Fxq "$line" file2
done < file1
```

### 3. Parallel Processing
```bash
# Using parallel
parallel "diff {} {}.bak" ::: *

# Using xargs
find . -type f | xargs -P4 -I{} diff {} {}.bak
```

## Troubleshooting

### 1. Common Issues
- Line ending differences
- Encoding issues
- Hidden characters
- Permission problems

### 2. Solutions
```bash
# Fix line endings
dos2unix file
unix2dos file

# Check encoding
file -i file
iconv -f ISO-8859-1 -t UTF-8 file
```

### 3. Debugging
```bash
# Show hidden chars
cat -A file
hexdump -C file

# Check permissions
ls -l file
stat file
```
